 * This program will prompt the user for three points that form a 
 * triangle and if it is not colinear it will calculate the triangle's
 * centroid, orthocenter and centroid. The program will then calculate 
 * the value of the biggest distance between the points. Then two of 
 * the points will be used to create a line that pass through them. 
 * Then the third point's distance to that line will be mesured. 
 * TODO enter resorces used to create program
